Foodie Delight - A simple Angular app written using version 17.

Total Development time - 8 hours (approx).

Planning and designing the UI - 2 hour : It included :- 
 1. Drawing a rough sketch of how the components would look like and what sort of filters does a minimilistic app requires. 
 2. Choosing color pattern for the UI and the font. 
 3. Deciding what libraries to use. 
 4. Getting Images for the prject.
 5. Using ChatGPT to generate mock data to be used. 


Development - ~5 Hours. It include :-
    1. Writing HTML, CSS and Ts code. 
    2. Creating Interfaces.
    3. Contemplating on whether to create complex mock data or not.

Test Cases - 1.5 Hours. I do not have a lot of experience with writing test cases but I have been learning them on my free time. Implemented basic test cases for few of the components. Took help of chatGPT and stackoverflow for the task.

Pushing the Code to GIT - 20 minutes

Created the repository and pushed the code.


There are lot of things i would like to add to this project and I will start working on them. As for now, promised that I will submit by Friday.
